Apologies if the download link is slow, that is because of the CI - at least it is guaranteed to be the newest version this way. Let me know if you find any mistakes. Feel free to yank anything you'd like from the cheatsheet, it's not like i wrote those Trigonometric Identities, etc. myself either. I wish you a pleasant rest of your lernphase and good luck for your exams <3
